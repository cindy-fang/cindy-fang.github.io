<h1>About Me</h1>

<p> <br> </p>
<img src= "cin.jpg" class="right" alt="me">
<p>
Hi! I'm Cindy Fang, an upcoming 3rd year Computer Science Co-op student
at Ryerson University, in Toronto, Canada.
</p>

<p> I am currently at Bell Canada as a Network intern within Smartcore MEC. 
    I'm halfway through the internship and I enjoy it greatly! 
    I'm involved with 6 teams where I learn and get opportunities to have 
    work experience by helping out my co-workers with their projects. My main 
    focus is to explore and learn as much as I can within the network smartcore MEC division. 
    Smartcore teams are focused on Multi Access Edge Computing and 5G, where we're developing 
    solutions to improve latency and bring wireline and wireless solutions to the EDGE. <br> <br>

    
After, I will continue my studies while pursuing a concentration in  
Software Engingeering and a minor in Econonmics. I'm expected to  
graduate in April, 2024 with a B.Sc. in Computer Science. </p>

<p>My interest in Computer Science started when I took a high school CS class and was immediately drawn to it. 
I loved using my creativity to create my own cool programs and be seen by others as those "hackers" from the movies.
Now a full-time CS student 4 years later, I plan on diving deeper into Software Development, while exploring Machine Learning and Networks as well.
</p>

<p>I enjoy sharing my passion for Computer Science by speaking at 
    webinars and in-class presentations on behalf of my program's 
    course union and IBM Z. As the consecutive year representative, 
    I aspire to be the voice for my peers while expanding their 
    interests in Computer Science. 
</p>

<p> Outside of Computer Science, my interests and hobbies include 
playing <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMcgZcZchVzWBgEgMOT5Yfg">piano</a>, 
dancing, reading webtoons and novels, listening to <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/user/226ks332yy4epmzk5g6tkkuqq?si=BKaSUA5KSoe2JdjiJmy6sw">K-pop</a>,

<h2>My Activities in School</h2>
<p>  </p>
<h3> Ryerson Computer Science Course Union</h3>
</h3>


<p>    
    The <a href="https://ryecscu.com/">Ryerson CSCU</a> is a group of dedicated student volunteers working to provide students the best experience at Ryerson CS.
</p>

<p>Due to COVID-19, we are operating virtually next semester and transition to in person events in the winter. Our <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/ryersoncscu/">events</a> will switch over to live broadcasting on 
    <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ryersoncscu">Twitch</a> and later be uploaded to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxZNP3s0RBaOT-nEEB7nAtg">YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<p>
    During my first year in CS, I was the first year representative, responsible for the overall prosperity and satisfaction of my peers. 
    I was elected as the second year representative where I once again foster healthy connections between the students and professors, and take action over any issues or questions.
    This year, I'm elected VP Careers and Outreach as I work to bring useful career resources and events to the student body to increase their involvement in the tech industry and preparation for job hunting.
</p>

<p>
    I also engaged in planning and hosting events that would best benefit the Ryerson CS community. Events I have taken part in hosting include the Why Ryerson Webinar, where 
    I gave a presentation on why incoming students should choose Ryerson CS, along with my own experience. I also took part of the Frosh Q&A Webinar representing the CSCU to answer and discuss any CS related questions from the viewers.

<p>    
    During my time as the second year rep, I co-hosted the Apply Together event where I gave tips on how to be co-op ready, presented feedback on resumes, and initiated conversations in breakout rooms.
</p>

<p>
    This year, I planned and hosted a <a href="https://youtu.be/LTKml6VVcPc">behavioural interview workshop</a> and a Q&A panel session with tech recruiters to teach soft skill concepts and prepare students for behavioural/case interviews. 
<p> <br> </p>
<h3> FoS Campus Engagement Ambassador </h3>

<p>
    The Ryerson Career and Co-op Centre (RCCC) works to provide students with career development resources through workshops, webinars, and one-on-one appointments. 
</p>

<p>As the Faculty of Science Campus Engagement Ambassador (FOS CEA), my work is to promote, plan, and present the resources and events of the RCCC. 
    I'm currently not working for the summer, and I'm excited to resume my position in the fall!
</p>

<p>    
    I mainly communicate to science students through Class Talks, where I explain what the RCCC is, what we offer, and the importance of seeking career advice to be industry ready.
</p>

<p>    
    Outside on-screen presentations, I manage the FOS channel in the Ryerson Career Development Slack Workspace to keep students updated on career/co-op tips and upcoming dates.
</p>

<p> <br> </p>

<h3> Ryerson Peer Mentor </h3>
<p>
    <img src= "hug.gif" alt="hug">
</p>
<p>
    As a peer mentor for 2 first year CS students, I worked as their guide to navigating the school year. 
    During our check-ins, I focused on answering questions, directing them to the best resources, and getting them engaged and comfortable in the Ryerson CS community.
</p>

<p>Being a peer mentor teaches me ways to improve myself from helping others.
    By listening, discussing, and problem solving obstacles with my mentees, I discovered different approaches to target non-academic struggles.
    I have used these strategies to enhance my study habits, stress management, and productivity. 
</p>

<p> <br> </p>



<h4>My Activities Outside School</h4>
<p> </p>
<h5> IBM ZAmbassador </h5>

<p>
    As a ZAmbassador, I promote and teach others about mainframe programming and its applications, mainly the Master the Mainframe global student contest (MTM).

</p>
<p> <br> </p>

<p>
    <img src= "mtmm.jpg" alt="mtm">
</p>
<p>   
    I manage the MTM North America Region <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ibmz.mtm/">Instagram</a> account to keep followers updated on important dates and events, along with intersting mainframe facts.
    I'm also a content creator of the IBM Global Student Hub, where I write informative blogs and film <a href="https://mediacenter.ibm.com/media/Programming+tips+for+begginers+by+cindyfang/1_pa2jmrcy">videos</a> for the student community. 
</p>

<p>For the IBM Z global conference, Z Day, I took on the position as the <a href="https://zambassador.com/zday/">Marketing Co-chair</a>, managing 40 members. 
    As the Co-chair, I assigned promotion materials, tracker sheet and deadlines to the committee.
    Together, we brainstormed our target market and promotion strategies to meet our goal.
    As a result, we reached over 225 student groups and unions, local organizations, and influencers from all over the world to promote the Z Day conference.

<p> 
    I was selected to attend the YOUNGA Youth UN Assembly along with 1500 other delegates worldwide. 
    Together, we discussed, exchanged ideas, and created solutions to global challenges. 
    I created ideas for the Climate Action (SDG 13) and Life Under Water (SDG 14) sustainability development goals.
    After the Assembly, I took part in developing the <a href="younga.pdf">YOUNGA Youth Delegate Communiqu√©</a>
    to take action on global issues and empower youth.
