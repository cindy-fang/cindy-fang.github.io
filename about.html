<h1>About Me</h1>

<p> <br> </p>

<p>
Hi! I'm Cindy Fang, currently a 2nd year Computer Science student
at Ryerson University, in Toronto, Canada.
</p>
<p> <br> </p>


<p> In Spring 2021, I will be interning at Bell Canada as a Network intern. 
After, I will continue my studies while pursuing a concentration in  
Software Engingeering and a minor in Econonmics. I'm expected to  
graduate in April, 2024 with a B.Sc. in Computer Science. </p>
<p> <br> </p>


<p>My interest in Computer Science started when I took a high school CS class and was immediately drawn to it. 
I loved using my creativity to create my own cool programs and be viewed by others like those "hackers" in the movies when I show my code.
Now a full-time CS student 4 years later, I plan on diving deeper into Data Science and Machine Learning, while exploring Software Development as well.
</p>
<p> <br> </p>

<p>I enjoy sharing my passion for Computer Science by speaking at 
    webinars and in-class presentations on behalf of my program's 
    Course Union and IBM Z. As the consecutive year representative, 
    I aspire to be the voice for my peers while expanding their 
    interests in Computer Science. 
</p>

<p> <br> </p>

</p>


<p> Outside of Computer Science, my interests and hobbies include 
playing <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMcgZcZchVzWBgEgMOT5Yfg">piano</a>, 
dancing, reading webtoons and novels, listening to <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/user/226ks332yy4epmzk5g6tkkuqq?si=BKaSUA5KSoe2JdjiJmy6sw">K-pop</a>,
and <a href="https://vsco.co/cindyyfang/gallery">photography</a>.</p>

<h2>My Activities in School</h2>
<p>  </p>
<h3> Ryerson Computer Science Course Union</h3>
</h3>


<p>    
    The <a href="https://ryecscu.com/">Ryerson CSCU</a> is a group of dedicated student volunteers working to provide students the best experience at Ryerson CS.
</p>
<p> <br> </p>

<p>Due to COVID-19, we are operating virtually this year. Our <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/ryersoncscu/">events</a> will switch over to live broadcasting on 
    <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ryersoncscu">Twitch</a> and later uploaded on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxZNP3s0RBaOT-nEEB7nAtg">YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<p> <br> </p>

<p>
    In my first year in CS, I was the first year representative, responsible for the overall prosperity and satisfaction of my peers. 
    This year, I'm the second year representative where I once again foster healthy connections between the students and professors, and take action over any issues or questions.
</p>
<p> <br> </p>

<p>
    Outside my year rep role, I also engage in planning and hosting events that would best benefit the Ryerson CS community. Events I have taken part in hosting include the Why Ryerson Webinar, where 
    I gave a presentation on why incoming students should choose Ryerson CS and my first year experience. I took part of the Frosh Q&A Webinar representing the CSCU to answer and discuss any CS related questions from the viewers. 
</p>
<p> <br> </p>

<p>    
    <img src= "AT.jpg" alt="Apply Together">
</p>
<p>    
    Most recently, I co-hosted the Apply Together event where I gave tips on how to be co-op ready, presented feedback on resumes, and initiated conversations in breakout rooms.
</p>


<p> <br> </p>
<h3> FoS Campus Engagement Ambassador </h3>

<p>
    The Ryerson Career and Co-op Centre (RCCC) works to provide students with career development resources through workshops, webinars, and one-on-one appointments. 
</p>
<p> <br> </p>

<p>As the Faculty of Science Campus Engagement Ambassador (FOS CEA), my work is to promote, plan, and present the resources and events of the RCCC.
</p>
<p> <br> </p>

<p>    
    I mainly communicate to science students through Class Talks, where I explain what the RCCC is, what we offer, and the importance of career advising from our team.
</p>
<p> <br> </p>

<p>    
    Outside on-screen presentations, I manage the FOS channel in the Ryerson Career Development Slack Workspace to keep students updated on career/co-op tips and upcoming dates.
</p>

<p> <br> </p>

<h3> Ryerson Peer Mentor </h3>
<p>
    <img src= "hug.gif" alt="hug">
</p>
<p>
    As a peer mentor for 2 first year CS students, I work as their guide to navigating the school year. 
    During our check-ins, I focus on answering questions, directing them to the best resource, and getting them involved in the Ryerson CS community.
</p>

<p> <br> </p>

<p>Through my experience as a peer mentor, I learned ways to improve myself from helping others.
    By listening, discussing, and problem solving obstacles with my mentees, I discovered different approaches to target non-academic struggles.
    I have used these strategies to enhance my study habits and stress management. 
</p>

<p> <br> </p>



<h4>My Activities Outside School</h4>
<p> </p>
<h5> IBM ZAmbassador </h5>

<p>
    As a ZAmbassador, I promote and teach others mainframe programming and its applications, mainly the Master the Mainframe global student contest (MTM).

</p>
<p> <br> </p>

<p>
    <img src= "mtmm.jpg" alt="mtm">
</p>
<p>   
    I also manage the MTM North America Region <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ibmz.mtm/">Instagram</a> account to keep followers updated on important dates and events, along with intersting mainframe facts.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>For the IBM Z global conference, Z Day, I took on the position as the <a href="https://zambassador.com/zday/">Marketing Co-chair</a>, managing 40 members. 
    As the Co-chair, I assigned promotion materials, tracker sheet and deadlines to the committee.
    Together, we brainstormed our target market and promotion strategies to meet our goal.
    As a result, we reached over 225 student groups and unions, local organizations, and influencers from all over the world to share the Z Day conference.
</p>

<h5> YOUNGA Youth UN Delegate </h5>

<p>
    <img src= "younga.jpg" alt="younga">
</p>
<p> 
    Attended YOUNGA Youth UN Assembly along with 1500 other delegates worldwide. 
    Together, we discussed global challenges, exchanged ideas, and created solutions. 
    I targeted the Climate Action (SDG 13) and Life Under Water (SDG 14) sustainability development goals.
    After the Assembly, I took part in developing the <a href="younga.pdf">YOUNGA Youth Delegate Communiqu√©</a>
    to take action on global issues and bring youth to action.
